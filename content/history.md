Before working on new projects with nowadays technology one should know about prior work and learn from past ideas - both succeed and failed attempts.


## 1950 - The Turing Test

Even before the term *chatbot* was coined people started working on machines that interact with humans.
<br>
One of the first important milestones was the 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" by Alan Turing[^1].
His ideas back then are still an important building block of what is call *chatbots* in todays world and his thoughts are still central to many discussions about artificial intelligence.
<br>
The most notable idea from this paper is the so called "Turing Test".
This test was meant to show if a machine posses human-like intelligence.
<br>
Originally Turing described this test as "imitation game" whereas the experiment consist of a human interacting with two parties via *textual messages*.
One of the parties will be another human and one will be a machine.
The human doesn't know upfront which one is the machine but only that one of them will be a machine.
During the *game* the human can interact, via what we nowadays call *chatting*, with the other party and is free to use any variation of messages.
If the human is not able to tell which of the two parties is a machine and which one is a human, the machine passes the Turing Test.
<br>
When creating a chatbot or another kind of artificial intelligence this test can still be applied to test the human-likeliness of the created machinery.
Up to this point in time the Turing Test still remains to be challenged by new systems.
<br>
However it needs to be noted that although creating an as human-like as possible system remains a popular challenge,
not all applications of chatbots profit from this type of behavior.
Sometimes systems are instead optimized to provide quick and efficient interactions and behave accordingly.
