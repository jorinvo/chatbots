Definition of the Term "Chatbot"
================================

Before working on a topic it is necessary to have a clear common understanding of its definition.
This section will help aligning previous assumptions.

The term "chatbot" consists of two parts - "chat" and "bot". The meaning can be better understood after examining the two components separately.

Oxford dictionary defines **"chat"** as *"an informal conversation"* and more specifically as *"the online exchange of messages in real time with one or more simultaneous users of a computer network"*.<sup>[1](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/chat)</sup>
<br>
As apparent in this definition conversations play a central role in *chats* and therefore *chatbots*.
But before examining what characterizes a conversation other noteworthy aspects of this definition are the inherent *informal* format of a *chat*, and the traits of being *online* and *real time*.
<br>
Informality doesn't have to be seen as a strict requirement; however a chat massage and, for example, a classical letter have different degrees of formality.
<br>
Being *online* and thereby not bound to a specific location, device or other physicality can be seen as critical foundation for determining potential types of systems to interact with such media.
<br>
The aspect of limiting communication to *real time* gives an important restriction on possible interactions and sets a baseline for the expected user experience. This also excludes the usage of certain technologies that don't allow for the desired responsiveness.
<br>
A conversation is defined as *"a talk, especially an informal one, between two or more people, in which news and ideas are exchanged"*.<sup>[2](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/conversation)</sup>
<br>
Important here is that there are always at least *two* parties involved in communication and that information is *exchanged*.
Keeping that in mind the kind of systems involved in this should always receive and provide information; chatbots can not work with solely unidirectional interaction.

**"Bot"** is defined as being *"(chiefly in science fiction) a robot"* with the specific characteristics of representing *"an autonomous program on a network (especially the Internet) which can interact with systems or users, especially one designed to behave like a player in some video games"*.<sup>[3](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bot)</sup>
<br>
Foremost this provides the information that *bots*, including *chatbots*, are *programs*.
It's important to internalize that the creation of a chatbot is eventually the creation of an artifact in the form of a computer program.
<br>
Furthermore the aspect of *autonomy* and the communication over a *network* can be connected with the previous described trait of a *chat* being *online*.
The program is given autonomy by not being bound to any specific device. Building on this allows for different solutions than a scenario where the user is in full control of a programs behavior.
<br>
Lastly there is a hint in this definition pointing out that a *bot* can often be seen as a *player* in a *game*.
This trend towards game-like mechanisms and the previous mentioned *informality* suggest the utilization of playful interactions.

Concluding from the combination of these definitions a chatbot can be defined as an autonomous computer program that interacts with users or systems online and in real time in the form of, often play-like and informal, conversations.
