Definition of the Term "Chatbot"
================================

The term "chatbot" consists of two parts - "chat" and "bot". The meaning can be better understood after examining the two components separately.

Oxford dictionary defines **"chat"** as *"an informal conversation"* and more specifically as *"the online exchange of messages in real time with one or more simultaneous users of a computer network"*.<sup>[1](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/chat)</sup>
<br>
As apparent in this definition conversations play a central role in *chats* and therefore *chatbots*.
But before examining what characterizes a conversation other noteworthy aspects of this definition are the inherent informal format of a *chat*, and the traits of being *online* and *real time*.
<br>
Informality doesn't have to be seen as a strict requirement; however a chat massage and, for example, a classical letter have different degrees of formality.
<br>
Being *online* and thereby not bound to a specific location, device or other physicality can be seen as critical foundation for determining potential types of systems to interact with such a media.
<br>
The aspect of limiting communication to *real time* gives an important restriction on possible interactions and sets a baseline for the expected user experience.
<br>
A Conversation is defined as *"a talk, especially an informal one, between two or more people, in which news and ideas are exchanged"*.<sup>[2](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/conversation)</sup>
The important parts here are that there are always at least *two* parties involved in communication and that certain informations are *exchanged*.
Keeping that in mind the kind of systems involved in this should always receive and provide information; chatbots can not work with only unidirectional interactions.

Furthermore **"bot"** is defined as being *"(chiefly in science fiction) a robot"* with the characteristics of representing *"an autonomous program on a network (especially the Internet) which can interact with systems or users, especially one designed to behave like a player in some video games"*.<sup>[3](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bot)</sup>
