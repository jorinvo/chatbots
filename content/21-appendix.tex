Studybot

Usage: chatbot [flags]

Studybot uses BoltDB as a database.
Data is stored in a single file. No external system is needed.
However, only one application can access the database at a time.

Studybot starts a server to serve a webhook handler that can be registered as a Messenger bot.
The server is HTTP only and a proxy server should be used to make the bot available on
a public domain, preferably HTTPS only.

An admin server runs on a separate port.
It should be proxied and secured via HTTPS + basic auth.
The admin server provides an endpoint to fetch backups of the database.
Further, it provides an endpoint that can be registered as Slack Outgoing Webhook.

When users send feedback to the bot, the messages are forwarded to Slack
and admin replies in Slack are send back to the users.


Flags:
  -admin int
    	Port admin interface listens on. (default 8081)
  -db string
    	Required. Path to BoltDB file. Will be created if non-existent.
  -port int
    	Port Facebook webhook listens on. (default 8080)
  -slackhook string
    	Required. URL of Slack Incoming Webhook. Used to send user messages to admin.
  -slacktoken string
    	Token for Slack Outgoing Webhook. Used to send admin answers to user messages.
  -token string
    	Required. Messenger bot token.
  -verify string
    	Required. Messenger bot verify token.
