Obstacles and Limitations
=========================

Notes

Here I will explain some features, technologies and architectural solutions that I considered using but ended up removing.


- Moving all our computing into the cloud and depending on closed chat platforms for everything
    at least support multiple so users have a choice

don't use the persistent menu. it's difficult to use and difficult to navigate back and forth.

editing is hard to do. only delete for now.

no instant search possible. is ok. but interaction is limited.

sql is not the best fit for this problem. better to precompute values.
