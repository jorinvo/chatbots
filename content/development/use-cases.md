Definition of Use Cases
=======================

### Notes

Features from previous synopsis should be expressed as user stories instead:

-	The software should not be restricted to specific languages.
-	I would like to decide which words to learn and the software should let me add my own vocabulary.
-	Most of the time, I want to memorize phrases or idioms instead of individual words.
-	I often need to look up translations. It would be convenient if the software supports translating and remembers my queries for later memorization practice.
-	Often, I would like to look up something in the vocabulary I created. The software should be easily searchable.
-	When repeating vocabulary it helps me to see my progress. It would be motivating to have statistics for my learning progress.

### System Language

-	English
-	German

> And what language would you like to study?

### Translations

-	Maybe this is not a good idea since a generic translation service doesn't yield helpful results for most languages.
-	For German I would use leo.org, for Japanese jisho.org and for Thai dict.longdo.com.
-	Since the focus should be on learning your own "slang" translation doesn't really fit into this service.
