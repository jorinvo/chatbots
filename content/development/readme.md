### Notes

-	Create an example for what a chatbot is
-	What parts does a chatbot consists of?
-	How can you implement these parts?
-	What existing tools are out there?
-	When to pick which tool?
-	Questions to answer after development:
	-	What was simpler to develop compared to a classical application?
	-	What was not possible and what was difficult?
