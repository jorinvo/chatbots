\chapter{Development}


To not only understand where chatbots can be applied but to also understand how a chatbot can be created in practice, this chapter guides through the development of an example chatbot.
\\
The description of the development process is kept on a more general level and many aspects of the presented architecture and solution can be reused when creating other kinds of chatbots.
\\

First of all a suited application needs to be chosen and specified in its requirements.
Before starting with the implementation, possible usage scenarios need to be defined and matching user stories have to be created.
\\
When all requirements are set, appropriate platforms, tooling and solutions can be selected.
\\
After all preparations are done the technical implementation can take place.
