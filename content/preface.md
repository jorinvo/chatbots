There have been many headlines about chatbots in recent time; yet still few people use them in their daily lives. That makes it uncertain in which businesses chatbots and their conversational user interfaces may be an improvement over the current, graphical interfaces.

In this thesis I would like to develop a chatbot specifically with the goal in mind to create a product people would actually use. Additionally, building on the experience of implementing a practical chatbot, I would like to research what applications chatbots are most suitable for and under which circumstances a chatbot is less beneficial.
