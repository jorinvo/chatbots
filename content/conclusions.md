-	Retrospecive looking on the previous stated potentials and promises
-	What worked well?
-	What didn't?
-	Also evaluating the technical merits drawbacks here

After I present the finished product, I would like to compare the chatbot with the classic application:

-	What limitations does the chatbot have?
-	Which features were not possible to implement?
-	Are there elements that are not intuitive to use?
-	Were there any issues with development?

*Furthermore:*

-	What are the advantages of the chatbot approach?
-	How does the user benefit from the conversational user interface?
-	Which implementation is easier to use?
-	Which steps of the development process have been simpler?
