Platforms
=========

Unless software is distributed on dedicated hardware a software product is designed to be run and accessed through other software.
The underlying software is the platform a product is created for.
<br>
Products that target operating systems such as Microsoft Windows or Apple's iOS require the users to install necessary executable files on their local system.
<br>
Other uses the web as platform, whereby customers use a web browser to access the software over the internet, while the software itself is executed on another computer called *server*.

In the case of chatbots the target platform can be any medium which enables users to send messages to each other.
A chatbot can be seen as a counterpart to interact with in the same way users interact with other users.

There are numerous platforms available that fulfill these requirements.

It should be noted that while messaging platforms provide means of communicating,
chatbots function similar to software accessible via a web browser;
a server executing the chatbots software is needed and the messaging platform communicates with the server in the same way a web browser does.

Because of the wide variety of available messaging platforms it is not possible to create an all-encompassing collection of available platforms in the context of this work; the following is an overview over the currently most popular platforms, their capabilities and their area of focus.

To begin with, one of the most used online communication platforms is E-Mail.
<br>
E-Mail however does not provide the earlier defined characteristics of chatbots to be able to communicate *informally* and in *real time*; there for it should not be regarded as a platform for chatbots, even though it can be used in similar ways.

Another well-know communication technology is **Short Message Service**, short SMS.
<br>
SMS is primarily used on mobile devices and users are identified by their phone numbers, wherefore the communication has to happen through cell network providers.
The technology is limited in number of characters, often users are charged by number of messages sent and communication is limited to text-only.
*"End of year 2009 user level for SMS globally was 78%, ie 3.6 Billion"* people worldwide which means it remains one of the most popular communication channels; and therefore is an interesting option for applications requiring a low entry barrier.



- Phone calls
Since chatbots can communicate not only via text but also using voice, even phone calls could be a possible medium.
-	Whatsapp is most popular (?) but has no public API and no chatbots
-	Facebook Messenger
-	Line (in Asia)
-	WeChat (in China)
-	QQ Mobile (in China)?
-	Telegram (for innovative features)
-	Kik?
-	Slack (mostly for business)
-	Skype (mostly for business)
