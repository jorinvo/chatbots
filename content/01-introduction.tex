% Why is it a problem?
Chatbots have gotten increased attention from media and industry,
but at the same time it is not yet well known why people are excited about them
and what to actually use them for.

% How do I intent to solve it?
The work attempts to give a holistic overview showing the different aspects of chatbots,
which include past and current platforms, products and technologies
and also the development of real chatbot.

% How will this help the world?
Goals of the work are to demystify what chatbots are,
to give people a good starting point to create new chatbots
and also to show the limits of what can be done with chatbots and which tasks are better solved with other technology.

% How is this work structured?
Starting with definitions of fundamental terms, which are the assumption the rest of the work is built on top of,
the first half of the work is focusing on showing the available platforms, products and technologies,
while the second half presents the development of an example chatbot including the design of user interactions and the selected technology.
