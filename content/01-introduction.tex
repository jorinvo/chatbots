\chapter{Introduction}

% What's the problem to be solved?
This work is an attempt at giving a general introduction to chatbots
by explaining what chatbots are, what they can be used for and how to develop them.
\\
No previous domain-specific knowledge is required.
\\

% Why is it a problem?
Lately as of writing topics around chatbots have received increased attention in media and also increased investments from different actors in the industry.
At the same time not many of potential users know about the existence of chatbots and the areas in which chatbots could be a good assistance.
The topic is equally unknown to most of potential developers.
\\
While the term itself is often used in media, the meaning mostly remains ambitious.
There is a need for further explanation of what chatbots are and for further analysis of well suited applications of chatbots.
Additionally to spreading knowledge about the potentials of chatbots their use cases,
more developers should be enabled to create interesting, new chatbots.
\\

% How do I intent to solve it?
The lack of knowledge can be solved by providing answers to the questions of what chatbots are, why they are promising and how to create them.
\\
An appropriate definition of chatbots can be given by analyzing the fundamental meaning of the term \emph{chatbot} and exploring past and current applications.
\\
Use cases for chatbots can be identified not only by exploring existing applications, but additionally market trends and attributes of media and technologies should be analyzed to find new, potential scenarios for the usage of chatbots.
\\
Development is best explained by creating an actual example chatbot and using it to present general principles of the development process.
\\

% How will this help the world?
Explaining what chatbots are, demystifying what to use them for and presenting how to create them,
will help more people to be able use and create chatbots and thereby accelerate the development of the chatbot ecosystem.
\\
Innovation in technology and the creation of new solutions can help in automating and simplifying more tasks,
which frees people to focus on more interesting issues and accomplish more things.
\\
Chatbots have the potential to simplify and automate many existing task and thereby accelerate technological progress.
\\

% How is this work structured?
The structure of this work follows the three main questions.
\\
To begin with, the terminology is defined and applications are explored to form a definition and understanding of what chatbots are.
\\
Use cases of chatbots are specified afterwards not only through the collection of existing use cases but also through the exploration of future potentials by analyzing attributes of the relevant technologies.
\\
The second half of the work is a case study for the development of a chatbot.
The presented example guides through the process of designing the user interactions of a chatbot and additionally explains architectural decisions and technological choices, which provide a basis for other developers to build on when creating new chatbots in the future.
