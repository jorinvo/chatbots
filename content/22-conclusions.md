Conclusions
===========

### Notes

-	Retrospecive looking on the previous stated potentials and promises
-	What worked well?
-	What didn't?
-	Also evaluating the technical merits drawbacks here

conversational interfaces don't have to rely inputing natural language,
conversations can also happen by providing possible answers,
the flow still differs from apps,
having this flow is more like telling a story,
variation in responses helps to keep the user engaged.

After I present the finished product, I would like to compare the chatbot with the classic application:

-	What limitations does the chatbot have?
-	Which features were not possible to implement?
-	Are there elements that are not intuitive to use?
-	Were there any issues with development?

*Furthermore:*

-	What are the advantages of the chatbot approach?
-	How does the user benefit from the conversational user interface?
-	Which implementation is easier to use?
-	Which steps of the development process have been simpler?


Have to differentiate chatbots as in natural language from bots as in automating messenger services and text interfaces.
