\section{Limitations}

- Moving all our computing into the cloud and depending on closed chat platforms for everything
    at least support multiple so users have a choice

- only online: needs internet and can be slower

- interface limited to certain applications, e.g. cannot implement photoshop
  but simple information-driven  not that interactive scenarios work well
  -> another tool made for certain usecases, not replacing websites or native apps,
  in the same way tv didn't replace radio and radio didn't replace newspaper,
  new medium with its strong points
