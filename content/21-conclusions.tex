\chapter{Conclusions}

This work introduced the fundamentals of what chatbots are.
\\
It gave an overview about ideas, products and platforms, both, from the past and available today.
\\
The current interest in chatbots, potential use cases and limitations have been explained.
\\
Further, details of the implementation of a chatbot and the different aspects of working with conversational interfaces
have been presented through the creation of an exemplary chatbot,
which included interaction design for the user experience and a general, reusable software architecture for chatbots.
\\

While not all aspects can be covered in the context of this work,
the goal was to give an overview about what chatbots are, their use cases and how to create them.
\\

This knowledge should help exploring further possibilities of chatbot usage
and it should enable more developers to apply chatbots to new scenarios and thereby also improve human-machine interaction in general.
