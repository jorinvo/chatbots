\chapter{Conclusions}

This work introduced the fundamentals of what chatbots are.
\\
It gave an overview about ideas, products and platforms, both, from the past and ones available today.
The current interest in chatbots, potential use cases and limitations have been explained.
\\
Further, details of implementing a chatbot and the different aspects of working with conversational interfaces
have been presented through the creation of a example chatbot,
which included interaction design for the user experience and a general, reusable software architecture for chatbots.
\\

While not all aspects can be covered in the context of this work,
the goal was giving an overview about what chatbots are, their use cases and how to create them.
\\
The knowledge should help exploring further possibilities of chatbot
usage and more developers should be enabled to apply chatbots to new scenarios and thereby improve human-machine interaction in general.
