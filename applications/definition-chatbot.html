                                <h1 id="definition-of-the-term-chatbot">Definition of the Term &quot;Chatbot&quot;</h1>
<p>Before working on a topic it is necessary to have common definitions of its vocabulary.
This section will help aligning previous assumptions.</p>
<p>The term &quot;chatbot&quot; consists of two parts - &quot;chat&quot; and &quot;bot&quot;. The meaning can be better understood after examining the two components separately.</p>
<p>The Oxford dictionary defines <strong>&quot;chat&quot;</strong> as <em>&quot;an informal conversation&quot;</em> and more specifically as <em>&quot;the online exchange of messages in real time with one or more simultaneous users of a computer network&quot;</em>.<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup>
<br>
As apparent in this definition conversations play a central role in <em>chats</em> and therefore <em>chatbots</em>.
But before examining what characterizes a conversation other noteworthy aspects of this definition are the inherent <em>informal</em> format of a <em>chat</em>, and the traits of being <em>online</em> and <em>real time</em>.
<br>
Informality doesn&apos;t have to be seen as a strict requirement; however a chat massage and, for example, a classical letter have different degrees of formality.
<br>
Being <em>online</em> and thereby not bound to a specific location, device or other physicality can be seen as critical foundation for determining potential types of systems to interact with such media.
<br>
The aspect of limiting communication to <em>real time</em> gives an important restriction on possible interactions and sets a baseline for the expected user experience. This also excludes the usage of certain technologies that don&apos;t allow for the desired responsiveness.
<br>
A conversation is defined as <em>&quot;a talk, especially an informal one, between two or more people, in which news and ideas are exchanged&quot;</em>.<sup><a href="#fn_2" id="reffn_2">2</a></sup>
<br>
Important here is that there are always at least <em>two</em> parties involved in communication and that information is <em>exchanged</em>.
Keeping that in mind the kind of systems involved in this should always receive and provide information; chatbots can not work with solely unidirectional interaction.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Bot&quot;</strong> is defined as being <em>&quot;(chiefly in science fiction) a robot&quot;</em> with the specific characteristics of representing <em>&quot;an autonomous program on a network (especially the Internet) which can interact with systems or users, especially one designed to behave like a player in some video games&quot;</em>.<sup><a href="#fn_3" id="reffn_3">3</a></sup>
<br>
Foremost this provides the information that <em>bots</em>, including <em>chatbots</em>, are <em>programs</em>.
It&apos;s important to internalize that the creation of a chatbot is eventually the creation of an artifact in the form of a computer program.
<br>
Furthermore the aspect of <em>autonomy</em> and the communication over a <em>network</em> can be connected with the previous described trait of a <em>chat</em> being <em>online</em>.
The program is given autonomy by not being bound to any specific device. Building on this allows for different solutions than a scenario where the user is in full control of a programs behavior.
<br>
Lastly there is a hint in this definition pointing out that a <em>bot</em> can often be seen as a <em>player</em> in a <em>game</em>.
This trend towards game-like mechanisms and the previous mentioned <em>informality</em> suggest the utilization of playful interactions.</p>
<p>Concluding from the combination of these definitions a chatbot can be defined as an autonomous computer program that interacts with users or systems online and in real time in the form of, often play-like and informal, conversations.</p>
